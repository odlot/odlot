- 🤔 Currently thinking about how to leverage AI to improve coding. I feel we have come a long way and agentic AI is so powerful. I fear that I will loose essential skills if I only delegate the "details" and focus on "architecting", then again, maybe I won't be needing the details in the future anymore? This keeps me up at night and I have no idea how to embrace this transition, so I try and play around with the stuff but also take the time to go slow.

## Current Projects
